## ‚ú® Overview

**SOFIA** assists you during your web browsing, capturing your interests and transforming them into a **living digital memory**, **secure**, and **verifiable via blockchain**.

But it's more than just an assistant:
- It **structures, contextualizes, and certifies** your digital identity.
- Thanks to the decentralized infrastructure of [Intuition.systems](https://www.intuition.systems/), every interaction can become an **atom**, a unit of knowledge.
- You decide whether this data remains **private**, **shared**, or **anchored on-chain**.

üß≠ **SOFIA** acts as:
- An **assisted journal**
- A **living personal graph**
- A **cognitive filter**
- An **ethical accomplice** to your digital memory
