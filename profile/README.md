**SOFIA** is a Chrome extension powered by artificial intelligence, designed as a personal intelligent agent. It assists you during your browsing sessions, captures your interests, and transforms them into a living, secure digital memory — verifiable via blockchain.

But it does more than just assist you: it structures, contextualizes, and certifies your digital identity. Thanks to the decentralized infrastructure of **Intuition.systems**, every interaction becomes an **atom** — a unit of knowledge you can either keep private or anchor on-chain, depending on your preference.

SOFIA listens, learns, and anticipates — intelligently organizing your navigation, reinforcing your interests, helping you plan, reflect, set goals, explore, or certify what you want to remember from the Web or real life — all in line with what you choose to store, share, or value.

Connected to Web3 but designed for everyone, SOFIA acts as a cognitive filter, an assisted journal, a living personal graph, and an ethical companion to your memory.
