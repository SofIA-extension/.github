# 🚀 Vision

**SOFIA** is a Chrome extension powered by artificial intelligence, designed as a personal intelligent agent. It assists you during your browsing sessions, captures your interests, and transforms them into a living, secure digital memory — verifiable via blockchain.

But it does more than just assist you: it structures, contextualizes, and certifies your digital identity. Thanks to the decentralized infrastructure of **Intuition.systems**, every interaction becomes an **atom** — a unit of knowledge you can either keep private or anchor on-chain, depending on your preference.

SOFIA listens, learns, and anticipates — intelligently organizing your navigation, reinforcing your interests, helping you plan, reflect, set goals, explore, or certify what you want to remember from the Web or real life — all in line with what you choose to store, share, or value.

Connected to Web3 but designed for everyone, SOFIA acts as a cognitive filter, an assisted journal, a living personal graph, and an ethical companion to your memory.

## 🕒 Why Now?

- Maturity of LLMs (GPT, Claude, etc.) for natural conversations  
- Semantic graph infrastructure ready via **Intuition Systems**  
- Rich public APIs (Maps, Calendars, Social Networks)  
- Rising demand for more personal, transparent, and ethical assistants  

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- **Build a certified and dynamic personal memory**, composed of weighted atoms reflecting your interests, actions, and preferences. Each atom can be adjusted, validated, paused, or deleted for full control.
- **Link your profile** to a global decentralized knowledge graph, with the ability to certify atoms on the blockchain and contribute to a shared trust network that enhances both your experience and the community's.
- **Contextualize your web navigation** by intelligently detecting your real intentions via significant actions (reading, searching, bookmarking) and assisted validation through **ElizaOS**, always under your control.
- **Bridge your digital and physical worlds** via an interface integrating maps, local events, and suggestions based on your budget, mood, and active interests.
- **Proactively support your daily life**, helping you define, track, and adjust your goals (projects, routines, mood) with an AI-guided journal and continuous feedback.
- **Offer ethical, opt-in targeting**, with full transparency and control over your data and personalized suggestions based on your preferences, location, and context.

## 🧩 Main Features

### 1. 🧠 Dynamic Personalization of Interests
Each interest becomes a **weighted atom** that you can:
- Adjust  
- Validate / Delete  
- Pause  
- Link to opt-in suggestions (products, events, content, etc.)

➡️ Forms a living graph of preferences used by **SYNAPSE** to personalize recommendations and conversations.

---

### 2. 🌐 Web Browsing as a Learning Ground

On every Chrome launch:
- A notification displays the number of detected atoms from your last session, ready to be added as **triplets**.
- Automatic detection of significant actions:
  - Reading articles
  - Repeated searches
  - Adding favorites or reactions
- These trigger the creation of **local, uncertified atoms**.

**Eliza** will later suggest certifying relevant atoms via blockchain.

You always retain full control with a dashboard view, and can toggle off navigation tracking at any time.

➡️ A hybrid approach combining intelligent automation with explicit consent.

> 🛑 Atoms **do not affect AI personalization by default**. To include them, you must **explicitly validate** or **publish** them via a **paid blockchain transaction**, ensuring both user control and system sustainability.

---

### 3. 🔄 Onboarding & Assisted Validation

- **Narrative AI onboarding** at signup:
  - Self-description (freeform or guided)
  - Define initial interests
  - Declare personal goals (fitness, projects, curiosities…)

➡️ ElizaOS uses this to initialize your graph.

- **Active behavior monitoring**:
  - Upon detecting patterns, Eliza asks:  
    _"Would you like to add this topic to your interests?"_

➡️ If accepted, a **local atom** is created.

---

### 4. 💎 Triplet Dashboard

A dedicated space to:
- View atoms by theme, source, and weight
- See origin: declared, detected, or browsed
- Delete / Certify / Adjust / Archive

➡️ Full transparency and control for the user.

---

### 5. 🗺️ Local Exploration (Activities, Events, Geo)

Integration with:
- 📍 **Google Maps API** → Local events, venues, activities  
- 🗓️ **Meta Events API** → Parties, exhibitions, concerts  

Filtered by:
- Your active interests
- Your current location
- Your personal context

➡️ Display options: grid, map, or favorites  
➡️ Suggestions via interactive pop-ups

---

### 6. 📆 Smart Journal & Personal Goals

AI-assisted journal interface:
- Daily routines, mood checks, quick thoughts
- Semi-automated goal planning:
  - 3 tasks/week
  - Weekly feedback
  - Smart readjustments

➡️ **SYNAPSE** becomes your hybrid personal coach.

---

### 7. 💬 ElizaOS — Contextual AI Agent

**ElizaOS** is the conversational core of SYNAPSE: proactive, adaptive, and contextual.

Functions:
- Conversational interface
- Detects explicit or implicit intent:
  - _"Are you planning a trip?"_  
  - _"You've searched for vegetarian recipes several times..."_

- Creates and updates intention atoms (local or certifiable)
- Offers personalized recaps, reminders, and recommendations

> Example:  
> - Atom: _"I like traveling", "I'm vegetarian"_  
> - Local Atom: _"Searched for travel options this week"_  
> - _"Max recommends this travel site, want to try it?"_

➡️ Creates a smooth link between your mind and your browsing.

---

### 8. 🗳️ Feedback & Certifications

Each piece of content (event, suggestion, article) can be rated via:
- 👍👎 Emojis  
- 🌡️ Emotional barometer  
- ⭐ Score system

Each feedback = public or private **micro-certification**:
- Generates trust or rejection atoms
- Feeds into your **trust score** (if enabled)
- Signals the AI agent for better suggestions

➡️ A valuable complement to AI detection.
